# Flash Cards Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a React-based flashcard application designed to help users study and review questions. It utilizes the useState hook to manage the selection state of flashcards, allowing users to click on cards to reveal their answers. Initially, no card is selected, and clicking a card will toggle its selection, displaying the answer if it's selected and the question otherwise. Each flashcard is represented as a clickable which is styled to highlight the selected card. The component dynamically maps over an array of questions to render each flashcard, making it easy to interact with and review content.
